## **Team Members:**
- Nadia Iskandar
- Ivy Fong

## **Project Description/Outline:**
We will create an interactive dashboard to display TTC subway delay 2019 data. Our dashboard will contain 3 views:

1.	Leaflet Map
	- Map of Toronto and TTC subway stations
	- Popups (on hover) displaying the name of the subway station, subway line, total number of delays in 2018, total number of delays in 2019, average minimum delay in 2018, and average minimum delay in 2019
2.	D3 bar graph
	- X-Axis1: Time of day 
	- X-Axis2: Day of week 
	- Y-Axis1: Average number of subway delays 
	- Y-Axis2: Average minimum delay (minutes)
	- Dropdown filters: Subway line and month
3.	Other Tableau visualizations to be embedded into HTML page - quick facts
4. 	Machine learning prediction results - predict the probability of delays at a certain time. 

## **Tools:**
We will use the following:
1. Python
2. HTML/CSS
3. Flask
4. JavaScript
5. Heroku/PostgreSQL

## **Data Sources:**
1.	City of Toronto Open Data - TTC monthly subway delay data: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/
2.	Wikipedia (multiple web pages) - TTC subway station coordinates (e.g. Bloor-Yonge station: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloor%E2%80%93Yonge_station)
